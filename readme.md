## Project test for factoria

I loved doing this project... I wanted to do many more things but for work reasons I couldn't dedicate more time to it. I love react and that's why I chose react for this project.
I know there's a lot more to do with this app, including protecting paths, proper endpoint management, validating all forms, better app composting, implementing access tokens, project trying not to using too many libraries to keep going. attached to the MERN stack but I am very happy with the result obtained due to time, the test requires TDD and the truth is that although I have already done tests in the joke and reaction test library I still do not have a good command and with the little time I prefer to dedicate to development.
Both the backend and the frontend are deployed, I will leave links below with the url and also the url of the backend repository
